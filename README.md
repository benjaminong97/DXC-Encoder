# DXC-Encoder

**Assumptions:**
1. Lower case characters are not included in the reference table (mapped back to same character).
2. The encoder will use a random character from the reference table as an offset character. 


To input an offset character instead of using a random character, delete line 13 - 15, and replace all "randomChar" with the preferred offset character).
